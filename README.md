## Overview

**MajorMatch** is a pro-bono, AI-powered guidance system designed to help high-school students choose undergraduate majors that align with their personality, academic strengths, and long-term aspirations.

Built by **Kaartik Issar**, the system blends **machine learning**, **psychometrics**, and **interpretable modeling** to generate personalized, evidence-backed recommendations.

Since deployment, MajorMatch has been adopted by **three schools in New Delhi, India**, serving **650+ high-school students annually**, with **500+ personalized reports generated** to date.

## Core Idea

Students often choose majors based on peer pressure, incomplete information, or short-term interests.  
MajorMatch reduces this risk by:

- analyzing a student's **Big Five personality profile**
- evaluating academic strengths  
- understanding long-term motivations  
- running a trained **Random Forest classifier**  

The system outputs:

- **Top 3 recommended majors**
- **Confidence scores**
- **Personality-alignment explanations**
- **Suggested next steps (courses, internships, etc.)**

## 🧠 Core Idea

Students often choose majors based on peer pressure, incomplete information, or short-term interests.  
MajorMatch reduces this risk by:

- analyzing a student's **Big Five personality profile**
- evaluating academic strengths  
- understanding long-term motivations  
- running a trained **Random Forest classifier**  

The system outputs:

- **Top 3 recommended majors**
- **Confidence scores**
- **Personality-alignment explanations**
- **Suggested next steps (courses, internships, etc.)**
